## User Story
Gym-goers and exercise experts track their activity to monitor and evaluate their fitness progress, as they work to exceed their goals .
We want to do this tracking and data collection with ease.

## Description and Usage
This application lets a user enter their New Workouts where the inputs will allow them to choose between Cardio or Resistance. 
    If Cardio is chosen, then the user will enter the Name of their workout, the Distance, and the Duration of the workout.
    If Resistance is chosen, then the user will enter their Exercise Name, Weight, Sets, Reps, and Duration of the workout.
    After this data is entered the user will select Add Exercise, or complete, and they can later view this information from the Dashboard to see their workout data displayed in various charts.
